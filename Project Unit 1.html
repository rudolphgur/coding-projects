      <h1>Into to the web</h1>

      <h2>Basics of the Web</h2>
      -Web
      <br>
      -HTML
      <br>
      -URLs

      <u>World Wide Web</u>
      <p> World Wide Web is a collection of HTML documents. HTML is the main type of document on the web. Documents are made up of HTML(<em> HyperText Markup Language</em>), which is the basis for web pages.</p>
      <u> Hyper Links</u> -  create links between documents. Links pages together.

      <h2> Components of the Web</h2>
      1. Browser makes requests via via internet to servers.
      <br>
      2. Servers respond with files that browser displays. <em>(servers are computers that host files. HTTP protocol is a protocol your browser uses to communicate with these servers)</em>
      <br>

      <h1> HTML Basics</h1>

      <u>HTML</u> - HyperText Markup Language
      <br>
      <br>
      HTML is made up of:
      <br>
      -<b>text content</b>(what you see)
      <br>
      -<b>Markup</b> (what it looks like)
      <br>
      -<b>References</b> to other documents (images, videos)

      <h2>Structure of HTML Markup</h2>

      <b>< name>Contents< /name></b>

      <p>Structure consists of opening and closing tags.
      An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML document or web page.</p>

      <b> Bold < b > </b> tag - makes any contents between opening and closing tags, <b>"bold"</b>.
      <br>
      <em>Em < em > </em> tag - emphasizes. Any content between < em > tag becomes <em>italic</em>.
      < em > renders as emphasized text.
      <br>

      <h2> Making Links</h2>

       <b>< tag ATTR=Value"Value">Contents= < / Tag></b>

      <p>Tags can have multiple attributes. An example of a tag that uses an attribute is an <u> anchor tag.</u>
      Anchors are used for making links such as follows:</p>
      <b> < a href= "www.reddit.com>"derp< /a> </b>
      <br>
      href is the attribtue name.  The url is the value.
      <br>
      This is an example of a link:
      <br>
      <br>
      <a href="https://www.udacity.com"> Click Here to Lean to Code!</a>
      <br>

      <h2> Adding Images</h2>
      <u> Image Tag</u> - <b> < img > </b> Defines an image in HTML.
      <br>
      <br>
      Structure of an image tag:
      <br>
      <  img  src = " url " alt = "text" >
      <br>
      Src = attribute
      <br>
      Url = image to download
      <br>
      alt = alternate
      <br>
      text = text displayed when image doesn't load
      <br>
      <p>Note: The image tag does not have a closing tag because there are no contents to images.
        The image tag is considered a <em>void</em> tag. A <em>void</em> tag has no content. Therefore, it has no closing tag.
        When using an image tag, although the <em>"alt=text"</em> portion isn't specifically required, it is stanard practice as a notification for broken requests to images.</p>
      <h3> This is an example of a working image tag</h3>


      <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">


      <h3> This is an example of a non-working image tag</h3>
      <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/xxxxxxx.jpg" alt="Mountain">
      <br>
      <br>

      <h1> White Space </h1>
      <p> <b> <  br  > </b> - Break tag. Without this tag, all text will appear on one line.
      With this tag, text breaks to next line. Since this is a <em>void</em> tag, there is no need for a closing tag.</p>

      eg: this text is really too long one line <br><br>
      or:   this text is really<br>
      too long one line<br><br>

      output: this text is really too long one line <br><br>

      <b>Using < br > tag:<br>
      </b>this text is really <  br ><br>
      too long one line <br><br>
      output:<br>
      this text is really<br>
      too long one line<br>

      <p> <b> < p > </b> tag - Paragraph Tag. This is another way of creating a line break. However, this is <b>not</b> a void since a P tag has content.
        Therefore, a P tag should have a closing tag <b>< /p></b>. This tag renders one paragraph. </P>

        Eg: <br>
        < p > This text is really < /p ><br>
        < p > too long one line < /p ><br>
        <br>
        Output:
        <p>this text is really</p>
        <p>too long one line</p>

      <h1>Inline vs Block Elements</h1>

      <p> When placing a < br > tag in the middle of a sentence, we don't have to have line breaks in the middle of html.
        This is regardless of how HTML is formatted. < br > is an inline tag. It is ending a line of text. Line ends at the end of the < br > and wraps to the next line.
        The  < p > tag is block tag. It creates an invisible box with a specified height and width.
        An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary. Examples of such elements are  < span >, < a >, < img >, < br >.
        A block element always starts on a new line and takes up full width available. Examples of block elements are < div >, < h1 >, < p >, < form >. </p>



      <h2> < span > and < div > </h2>

      <p> Both are normal elements that can have content. These elements contain their content.
        You can attach files to adjust behaviors of how they display.
        However,  < span > is inline, while < div > is a block element.
        You can attach attribute class (css) to < span > and < div >  </p>
        eg:  < span class="foo">      <  div class=bar">
        <br>
        <br>

        eg:<br>
        < span > this is one line < / span>. <br>
        yep, one line <br><br>
        ouput:
        <br>
        <span>this is one line</span>.
        yep, one line
         <br>
         <br>
      eg: <br>
      < div > this is one line < /div>. <br>
      yep, one line <br><br>
      ouput:
      <br>
      <div>this is one line</div>.

      yep, one line
      <br>

      <h1> Structure of HTML Document </h1>

      <img src="http://www.scriptingmaster.com/images/html/basic-html-tags.GIF" alt="HTML_Structure">
      <br>
      <br>
      <p> Doctype is just the string HTML. The title of the page displays what appears at the tope of the browser window.
        The content inside the body tag < b >  content  < /b > are all the contents of the document.
        The head contains meta-data such as Java script and CSS.  The opening and closing tags < html >, < /html>,  surround the entire document. </p>

      <h2> Indentation</h2>
        <p> New indentation means that there is a new idea. Indentation persists throughout an idea.
          In HTML, indentation level increases when an idea begins and decreaes when an idea is finished. </p>

      <h1> Code Dissection </h1>
      1. first line < html > defines type of document so browser renders it correctly.
      <br>
      2. < html > tag opens document. Everything showing on webpage is within this tag.
      <br>
      3. < head > tag defines metadata: Title of page (what appears on top of tab or browser window).
      <br>
      4. < title > tag is closed on same line it was opened. Done if content of tag is short.  < head > tag closed on different line. Closing tag is indented to same level as matching opening one.

      <p>  < body > tag : contents of web page are inside the body tags. < h > tag is indented insde body as well as < p > tag that is on same level
        of indentation as  < h >.
    </body>
</html>
